# Advent Of Code 2021
This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenge written in [Go](https://go.dev/), this time I am not only learning how to solve these problems, also is my first time with Go, so like we say in spanish "Voy a matar dos pajaros de un tiro" this means that doing this challenge has double purpose, improve my problems solving skills and learn a new programming language, so enjoy it.
